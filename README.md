# Encrypt_BAS

This project is to spread info about basic encryption techniques and it's working process in them.
Some of the basic encryption methods, which actually date to 17th Century(*not confirmed) are Caesar cipher, Vigenere cipher.

Note:If you want to learn more about cipher techniques, you can really learn them in websites like Brilliant.org , wikipedia.com etc.

There is also an app called '**Crypto**' which is available in Play store(for App store,IDK :) ). It provides all tools about ciphers and more advanced techniques like Certificate generation etc.

Link for **Crypto** is given below:

***Note:Crypto doesn't provide info about all cipher techniques, it just provides tools..***
